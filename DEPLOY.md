   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex

## üéØ Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Login to Fly.io**

```bash
fly auth login
```

This opens your browser for authentication.

---

### **Step 2: Launch App**

```bash
fly launch
```

**Interactive prompts:**
```
? Choose an app name: weiweiji (or leave blank for auto-generated)
? Choose a region: Hong Kong, Hong Kong (hkg)  ‚Üê SELECT THIS!
? Would you like to set up a Postgresql database? No
? Would you like to set up an Upstash Redis database? No
? Would you like to deploy now? No  ‚Üê Say NO (we need to set secrets first)
```

This creates `fly.toml` configuration file.

---

### **Step 3: Set Secrets (Environment Variables)**

```bash
# Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
fly secrets set GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id

# AWS Polly
fly secrets set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
fly secrets set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
fly secrets set AWS_REGION=ap-east-1

# OpenRouter
fly secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
fly secrets set OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
fly secrets set YOUR_SITE_URL=https://weiweiji.fly.dev
```

---

### **Step 4: Set Google Credentials from JSON File**

```bash
# This reads google-credentials.json and sets as secret
cat google-credentials.json | fly secrets set GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON=-
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-Content google-credentials.json | fly secrets set GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON=-
```

---

### **Step 5: Deploy!**

```bash
fly deploy
```

This will:
1. Build Docker image
2. Push to Fly.io registry
3. Deploy to Hong Kong region
4. Run health checks
5. Start serving traffic

**Deployment takes ~2-3 minutes.**

---

### **Step 6: Open Your App**

```bash
fly open
```

Your app is now live at:
```
https://weiweiji.fly.dev
```

(Or whatever app name you chose)

---

## üîç Verify Deployment

### Check app status
```bash
fly status
```

### View logs
```bash
fly logs
```

### Check regions
```bash
fly regions list
```

Should show:
```
hkg (primary)
```

---

## üéõÔ∏è Manage Your App

### Scale instances
```bash
# Scale to 2 instances (for redundancy)
fly scale count 2

# Scale memory
fly scale memory 1024  # 1GB RAM
```

### View secrets
```bash
fly secrets list
```

### Update a secret
```bash
fly secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=new-key
```

### SSH into container (debugging)
```bash
fly ssh console
```

### Restart app
```bash
fly apps restart weiweiji
```

### App won't start
```bash
# Check logs for errors
fly logs

# Common issues:
# 1. Missing secrets ‚Üí fly secrets list
# 2. Port mismatch ‚Üí Check PORT in fly.toml
# 3. Health check failing ‚Üí Check /health endpoint
```

### STT not working
```bash
# Verify Google credentials
fly ssh console
echo $GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON | head -c 100

# Should show: {"type":"service_account"...
```

### High latency
```bash
# Verify region is HK
fly regions list

# Should show: hkg (primary)
```

### Out of memory
```bash
# Scale up memory
fly scale memory 1024
```

---

## üîÑ Update Deployed App

After making code changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature X"
git push origin main

# Then deploy
fly deploy
```

**Zero-downtime deployment** - new version deployed, old version removed only after health checks pass!

---

## üìä Monitoring

### View metrics
```bash
fly dashboard
```

Opens web dashboard showing:
- CPU/Memory usage
- Request counts
- Response times
- Error rates

### Set up alerts (optional)
